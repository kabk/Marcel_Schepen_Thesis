<h1>CHAPTER 1: MODERN HISTORY OF KOREA UNTIL 1960</h1>
<p>How can a rose blossom from a garbage dump? (Alternate title?)
- Vengalil Menon / Head of UN Special Delegation</p>
<p>
When I was in the metro, traveling through Seoul, there was an older man. He looked at me and I was a bit annoyed by his staring. Then he put up his hand as a friendly notion to say hello to me. I bowed and he started talking. He asked me where I came from, so I told him I'm from Holland, visiting Korea to do research on Korean youth culture. He was very interested and also telling me a bit about himself. 
He told me he was 76 six years old and still working. After we had to get off at the same station he continued talking and helped me around the station a bit. I was surprised about his English because mostly elder people in Korea don't speak English or even hardly understand the language. He explained to me that during and right after the Korean War there was no food and people were very poor. The man was very small, he only came up to my chest. He explained that Koreans stopped growing due to malnutrition. In this war and right after, there was hardly any food available. And because I complimented him on his English he told me this got so good because his family had special contact with an American soldier, who was from a wealthy family, he financially supported them after the war and thanks to this the he could go into college. Every 7 years they would meet again.</p> 
<p>He was very happy to see that more and more foreigners are visiting South Korea so he could still keep up with his English. And it pleased him that Korea gained so much in wealth. He himself grew up in Hongdae, now a youngster/ college kids area but it used to be totally different, with lower buildings. The conversation abruptly ended because I had to get my metro, which eventually sent me in the total wrong direction...
After this conversation I noticed what an impact this war was on the people. And how little I know about this war. This is why this chapter is so important for me, to understand the culture and their drive to become a superpower.</p> 
<p>Before the Korean war, which caused the split of North and South Korea, Korea was part of the Japanese empire. In 1592 Japan invaded the peninsula to pave its way for its incursion into China. However this failed Korea remained to be a “Hermit Kingdom”. Over time, a few Asian and European countries with imperialistic ambitions competed with each other for influence over the Korean Peninsula. But Japan, after winning wars against China and Russia, forcibly annexed Korea and instituted the colonial rule in 1910. The colonization process stimulated the patriotism of Koreans. Korean intellectuals were angered by Japan's cultural assimilation policy, which even banned Korean-language education in schools. The colonial rule ended by the end of the Second World War in 1945.</p>

<p>The founding of Republic of Korea</p>

<p>Even before they could enjoy the fruits of their freedom due to the surrender of Japan after the Second World War. The liberation didn’t bring the independence the Koreans fought so hard for. Instead it resulted in a country divided by ideological differences. Korean efforts to gain an independent government were frustrated as Soviet troops took control over the north and U.S. forces occupied the southern half of the peninsula. And with the emergence of the Cold War this was not going to end soon.</p>
<p>On June the 25, 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea poured 75,000 soldiers across the 38th parallel.3 A division between the Soviet-backed (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) North- and the pro-Western (Republic of Korea) South- Korea  was based on the circle latitude that is 38 degrees north of the Earth’s equatorial plane.</p>
<p>This invasion was the first military action of the Cold War. And as far as American officials were concerned, it was a war against the forces of international communism itself. At the same time, American officials worked fearful to construct a peace between the two Korea’s. The alternate, they feared, would be a wider war with Russia and China. Or even, as some people warned, World War III. The U.S. “police action” was run by a UN (United Nations) international peace- keeping force but actually the UN was being manipulated by U.S. and NATO anti-communist interests.</p>
<p>When after more than two years of negotiations the adversaries signed a treaty was signed on July 27, 1953. The agreement allowed the prisoners of war to stay where they liked, drew a new boundary near the 38th parallel that gave South-Korea an extra 3500 square kilometers of territory; and created a 3-kilometer-wide “demilitarized zone” that still exists today.</p>
<p>Although the Korean War was approximately short, it was extremely bloody. Nearly 5 million people died. More than half of these people were civilians and about 10 percent of Korea's prewar population. Almost 40,000 American soldiers died in action in Korea, and more than 100,000 were wounded. North Korea was left under communist rule after the treaty of 1953, and to this day it remains a poor and troubled nation.
South Korea's growth- oriented development was led under the leadership of Park Chung-Hee4, The general-turned-president, from 1960 following 18 years of authoritarian rule. His effect on Korea's development was so remarkable that it earned the name “the Miracle on the Hangang River.”
However during the busy efforts of restoration after the war, education became South Korea's highest priority. With a struggle from day to day and children traveling over long distances to go to school, the Korean parents did not ignore the importance of education. This dedication to, and investment in, education produced a highly trained workforce that would become later on one of the forces behind Korea's economic turn-around.</p>

<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>“What is an authentic national culture when some alien
cultural practices are so quickly assimilated that after a short while they are no longer remembered as alien”
- John Tomlinson<br></br>
South-Korea was once one of the poorest and least fashionable countries in the world. But over the last couple of decades it changed itself into a High-tech nation and cultural superpower. Undergoing colonial domination, war, rapid economic growth and a financial crisis all within the same century. Popular Korean youth culture is mentioned as one of the quickest flourishing youth cultures in the world. This all started when Hallyu also called the Korean Wave was born and was first mentioned by media in 2001.
The first notions of a youth culture came when western pop culture was introduced in South-Korea by U.S. Armed Forces, a powerful symbol of postwar American hegemony. Here was the start of “Rok” the Korean appropriation of Rock music. But was later banned by the militaristic regime of Park Chung Hee.
In my thesis I will answer my question “What effected popular youth culture in South-Korea from the 1960’s onward?” I am going to look into the history of South-Korea and how it became this High-Tech nation and cultural superpower. I will write about the first attempts of creating a youth culture and later draw in examples about cultural imperialism and Confucianism. Also I will interview Koreans who have been part of this change and interview Koreans who moved abroad and came back to a country which evolved into an alienated country to them. Finally I will write about the Hallyu that eventually became the “Korean Dream”.<br></br>
