<h1>CHAPTER 1: VISUAL CULTURE</h1>
<p>1.1	What is a pop culture?</p>
<p>To understand a pop culture it is recommended to have a better understanding about visual culture. This raises the question, What is visual culture? A visual culture means the predominance of visual forms of media, communication, and information in the postmodern world . This term is still a bit vague; it implies that there could have been a cultural shift to the visual over against the verbal and textual. But the ‘visual culture’ supports the reality of living in a world of interventions on different levels where in history these expressions were less visible. Our experience of culturally meaningful visual content appears in multiple forms that could be “high” and “low” cultural forms such as print images and graphic design, Television and broadcasting networks, film and video, computer interfaces and software design, digital multimedia, fine art and photography, fashion but also architecture, design, and urban design.</p> 

<p>This growth of visual culture has a lot to do with technical development but also with the upcoming of postmodernism, a movement that started after/ around the two world wars. This movement assumes the idea that we cannot speak of any universal truth, reason or morality. We just have fragmented perspectives. 
But what then is a pop culture? Pop culture is the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes images and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture, which is different than folk culture. Folk culture is a culture that is homogenous in ethnicity, rural and consists of a smaller population. Where folk culture is only linked to ethnicity, pop culture exists out of many ethnic groups and develops itself slower than pop culture. Folk culture is what we could see as more traditional.</p> 

<p>Norman Mailer suggests that a pop culture started when there was an upcoming of a counterculture, a youth culture. Norman Mailer first noted an upcoming movement of a pop culture in the west in his essay “The White Negro: superficial reflections on the hipster” . In this essay he described American Existentialists what he calls “Hipsters”. He describes these young white people around 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The described hipster refuses submission to the anxieties that are the result of various wars. In fact, the hipster can only function on the outskirts of society, for he defines himself in opposition to any notion of collective responsibility. He is “rarely an artist,” and “never a writer”, but more likely “a minor criminal, a hobo, a carnival worker or a free-lance moving man in Greenwich Village”. He is his only engagement. The hipster wanted to make his own decisions and started to listen to typical “black” music like jazz and swing music and dressed himself in a different fashion so much that he adopted the “black” culture as it’s own to break free from the paths of society and previous generations. Living a life surrounded by death as a result of various alarming wars and being constrained by social conformity this movement eventually resulted in a youth culture that around the 1960s that was seen as popular culture.</p>

<p>1.2 What is interesting about Korean pop culture?</p>

<p>South-Korea was once one of the poorest and least fashionable countries in the world. But over the last couple of decades it changed itself into a High-tech nation and cultural superpower. Popular Korean culture is mentioned as one of the quickest flourishing pop cultures in the world. The song Gangnam Style from Korean rapper PSY has over 21 billion views on youtube. Fillipinos are hooked on Korean drama’s, the French love it’s pop music and their movies. In 2013 Korea made $5 billion from its pop-culture exports and the country has set its sights on doubling that by 2017 . This describes more the attitude of the country, there are also visual differences in the korean pop culture.</p> 

<p>In writing you can see that Korean writing is different from other asian writings. The text is set in Hangul, the native alphabet of Korea. This script was created during the Joseon dynasty in 1443  and is based on phonetics. The script exists out of 24 letters but are grouped in blocks instead of in a row what is done in Latin alphabet. K-Pop is another example. K-Pop is a musical genre originating from South Korea and stands for Korean Pop music. The music is a mix of different genres like pop, rock, hiphop, RnB and electronic music. K-Pop can be described as globalized music; it is a mixture of Western and European sounds with an Asian flavor of performance.  Contemporary Korean art could also be suggested as globalized art and gains rapidly ground in the international art scene. With their artists often educated in London or New York.</p> 

<p>Based on these statements I assume that most of it’s pop culture is a fusion between Western, European and other cultures which could be because of the fact that their students study abroad at Western and European universities and after their studies will move back to Korea to start with their career.</p>
<br>
<p>1.3 This could be interesting because…</p>
 
<p>There are two ways to look at this question. When I was talking with Koreans in Seoul about the Hallyu , the flow and spread of Korea, they mentioned me that people say that the three economic powers in eastern asia follow eachother up. First you have Japan, ten years later Korea follows and ten years after that China will follow with a quick economic growth. Stating this, it could be interesting to see how the chinese growth will develop and using these growths of Japan and Korea as a theory you could predict the growth of China.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that as mentioned earlier Korea is a fusion of different cultures. While things are evolving rapidly, it is still sufficiently normal, for foreigners, to be at a loss to understand what Koreans are thinking in many situations. At the point when addressed around an especially odd or nonsensical appearing perspective, a typical answer is “Because I am Korean," which says everything and nothing. Additionally, Koreans have a tendency to view society, nationality, dialect, and race as one-and-the-same and this may result in a genuine inability to grasp Western concepts of multi-cultural societies, where individuals are equal to each other. A Korean might, quite accurately, point out that indeed we are not equal and find it strange that we ‘imagine’ being different.</p>

<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>“What is an authentic national culture when some alien
cultural practices are so quickly assimilated that after a short while they are no longer remembered as alien”
- John Tomlinson<br></br>
South-Korea was once one of the poorest and least fashionable countries in the world. But over the last couple of decades it changed itself into a High-tech nation and cultural superpower. Undergoing colonial domination, war, rapid economic growth and a financial crisis all within the same century. Popular Korean youth culture is mentioned as one of the quickest flourishing youth cultures in the world. This all started when Hallyu also called the Korean Wave was born and was first mentioned by media in 2001.
The first notions of a youth culture came when western pop culture was introduced in South-Korea by U.S. Armed Forces, a powerful symbol of postwar American hegemony. Here was the start of “Rok” the Korean appropriation of Rock music. But was later banned by the militaristic regime of Park Chung Hee.
In my thesis I will answer my question “What effected popular youth culture in South-Korea from the 1960’s onward?” I am going to look into the history of South-Korea and how it became this High-Tech nation and cultural superpower. I will write about the first attempts of creating a youth culture and later draw in examples about cultural imperialism and Confucianism. Also I will interview Koreans who have been part of this change and interview Koreans who moved abroad and came back to a country which evolved into an alienated country to them. Finally I will write about the Hallyu that eventually became the “Korean Dream”.<br></br>
