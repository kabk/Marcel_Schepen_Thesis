<div class="textwrapper">
<p>The purpose of this thesis is to map out and assess the rise and changing path of (visual) South Korean [hereafter Korea] pop culture at a broad stroke. The intention of this thesis is to provide useful signposts toward a more nuanced understanding on the politics of culture and the popular culture within the mainstream in its complex potential, which means that culture is more than just a set of rules. It also represents formalities and norms of a society, including its language, art, graphic design, fashion, laws and religion. Meanwhile, the goal of this thesis is to make Korean culture understandable by drawing on examples of the history of Korea and Confucian sensibilities that still have a big prominence in the Korean (visual) cultural field, but also daily life as it is today. Admitting that a European perspective colors my interpretation of the Korean culture since I was born, raised and educated in Europe, I will nevertheless do my best to look at this case with a neutral mindset. In the rear of my trip to Seoul, at the end of October 2014, there was the opportunity to observe the Korean pop culture and a lot of perspectives are based on my observations and talks with the inhabitants of Seoul.</p><br><p>For this thesis the need of information on historical events should give a better understanding of the Korean culture. Thanks to oppression by other nations for decades the Korean Culture did not have the freedom to develop itself through its own sensibilities, but most likely are affected by other sensibilities like Western globalization. Furthermore this thesis will draw parallel lines between North American, and European popular culture to the Korean popular culture as an attempt to look for similarities between Korea and the West. This is because Korea has gone through an intense period of modernization after the Korean War and has been heavily exposed to the process of a globalization. Also through this thesis we will look at events that have been the first sparks of a pop culture and eventually the beginning of an export of their culture through ‘low’ culture like K-pop and television dramas. As an effect of these events my the expectations for this thesis would be that through the experience of oppression and exposition to globalization, Koreans always manage to give it a twist with typical Korean ideals. It could be that this fuse of different sensibilities, so called eclecticism is a typical Korean sensibility and could be a blueprint of possibilities for the potential of the Korean culture in the near future.</p>
<br>
<p>I will research the question <i>“What is typical about the Korean (visual) popular culture from 1960 onward?” </i>Through this research I am going to write about the history of South Korea and how it became this high tech nation and cultural superpower.</p>
<br>
<p>A big inspiration for writing this thesis is from a quote of John Tomlinson, an English writer and professor on globalization. <i>“What is an authentic national culture when some alien cultural practices are so quickly assimilated that after a short while they are no longer remembered as alien?” <sup><a href="#sources">1</a></sup></i>  With this quote as a resonating question I will write this thesis.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the most special moments I had in Seoul was, travelling by metro through the city. In the metro there was an older man. He kept staring at me, which made me ask myself why he was staring. As a result of this he put up his hand as a friendly notion to say hello to me. I bowed and he started talking. He asked me where I came from. I told him that I was from Holland, visiting Korea to do research on Korean pop culture. He was very interested and was also telling me a bit about himself. He told me he was 76 years old and still working. The man was very small; he only came up to my chest. He explained that Koreans stopped growing due to malnutrition. In the Korean War and right after, there was hardly any food available. He was very happy to see that more and more foreigners are visiting South Korea so he could still keep up with his English.</p>
<br>
<p>And it pleased him that Korea gained so much in wealth. After this conversation I noticed what an impact the Korean War had on the people, and how little I knew about this war. This is why I want to understand the culture, their drive to become a cultural superpower and what makes them different form other Eastern Asian countries.</p>

<h3>1.1 What is a pop culture?</h3>
<p>To understand a pop culture it is recommended to have a better understanding about visual culture. This raises the question: what is visual culture? A visual culture has different meanings: in this thesis the term will be used as a predominance of visual forms of media, communication, and information in the postmodern world<sup><a href="#sources">2</a></sup>. This term is nevertheless a bit vague; it implies that there could have been a cultural shift to the visual the verbal and textual. But the ‘visual culture’ supports the reality of living in a world with interventions on different levels while in history before the digitalization and globalization these expressions were less visible. Our experience of culturally meaningful visual content appears in multiple forms that could be subdivided in “high” and “low” cultural forms with “high” as an innovative art style or art movement and “low” such as print images and graphic design, television and broadcasting networks, film and video, computer interfaces and software design, digital multimedia, fine art and photography, fashion but also architecture, design, and urban design<sup><a href="#sources">3</a></sup>. This growth of “low” culture of visual culture that started in the 20th century has a lot to do with technical development but also with the upcoming of postmodernism, a movement that started between the two world wars Postmodernism assumes the idea that we cannot speak of any universal truth, reason or morality. We just have fragmented perspectives. But what is a pop culture? Pop culture is heterogeneous, and the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes images and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture, which is different than folk culture. Folk culture is a culture that is homogenous in ethnicity, is rural and consists of a smaller population than pop culture. Where folk culture is only linked to ethnicity, pop culture exists out of many ethnic groups and develops itself quicker than folk culture. Folk culture is what we could see as traditional<sup><a href="#sources">4</a></sup>. <p>
<br>
Norman Mailer (1923 - 2007), an American journalist and essayist, suggested that a pop culture starts when there is a counterculture upcoming, a youth culture. Norman Mailer first noted an upcoming movement of a pop culture in the west in his essay: <i>“The White Negro: superficial reflections on the hipster”<sup><a href="#sources">5</a></sup></i>. <i>(Fig. 1)</i> 
In this essay he described American Existentialists, who he called “Hipsters”. He described young white people in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The described hipster refuses submission to the anxieties that are the result of various wars. In fact, the hipster can only function on the outskirts of society. The hipster defines himself in opposition to any notion of collective responsibility. He is “rarely an artist,” and “never a writer”, but more likely “a minor criminal, a hobo, a carnival worker or a free-lance moving man in Greenwich Village”<sup><a href="#sources">6</a></sup>. <i>(Fig. 2)</i> He is his only engagement. The hipster wanted to make his own decisions and started to listen to typical “black” music like jazz and swing music and dressed himself in a different fashion so much that he adopted the “black” culture as his own culture to break free from the paths of society and previous generations. Living a life surrounded by death, as a result of various alarming wars, and being constrained by social conformity, this movement eventually resulted in a youth culture and by the 1960s it became a part of popular culture.
<br>

<h3>1.2 What is interesting about the 
globalizing (visual) Korean pop 
culture compared to the West?</h3>
<br>
<p>Korea was once one of the poorest and least fashionable countries in the world. But over the last couple of decades it changed itself into a High-tech nation and cultural superpower. Korean popular culture is mentioned as one of the quickest flourishing pop cultures in the world. The song ‘Gangnam Style’ <i>(Fig. 3) </i>from Korean rapper PSY has over 21 billion views on YouTube. Filipinos are hooked on Korean dramas, the French love Korea’s pop music and their movies<sup><a href="#sources">7</a></sup>. In 2013 Korea made $5 billion from its pop-culture exports and the country has set its sights on doubling that by 2017<sup><a href="#sources">8</a></sup>. This describes more the attitude of the country. </p>
<br>
<p>There are nevertheless also visual differences in the Korean (pop) culture. In writing you can see that Korean writing is different from other Asian writings. The text used on the streets and other visual material is set in Hangul, the native alphabet of Korea. This script was created during the Joseon dynasty in 1443<sup><a href="#sources">9</a></sup> and is based on phonetics (Fig. 4). The script exists out of 24 letters but is grouped in blocks instead of in a row what is done in Latin alphabet. In the west we mainly see Hangul through the bright colored video clips of K-Pop. K-Pop is a musical genre originating from South Korea and stands for Korean Pop music. The music is a visual and musical mix of different genres like pop, rock, hip-hop, RnB and electronic music. K-Pop can be seen as globalized music; it is a mixture of North American and European sounds with an Asian flavor of performance<sup><a href="#sources">10</a></sup>. Contemporary Korean art could also be suggested as globalized art, which rapidly gains ground in the international art scene. With their artists often educated in London or New York<sup><a href="#sources">11</a></sup>. </p>
<br>
<p>Based on these statements there is a suggestion that most of Korea’s pop culture is a fusion between Western, European and other cultures which could be due to the fact that their students study abroad at European and North American universities and after their studies will move back to Korea to start their careers.</p>
<br>

<h3>1.3 This could be interesting because?</h3>
 <br>
<p>There are two ways to look at this question. Firstly, as I observed Seoul and had conversations with Koreans about the Hallyu (The Korean wave), they mentioned to me that people say that the three economic powers (Japan, South Korea and China) in East Asia that succeed each other. In the beginning you have Japan, as a follow up Korea would join ten years later and ten years after that China would follow as the economic power. That being said, China will do this most likely with a quick economic growth that is quicker than those of Japan or Korea. Stating this, it could be interesting to see how the Chinese growth will develop and using these growths of Japan and Korea as a theory you could predict the growth of China.</p>
<br>
<p>Secondly, another interesting fact is that as mentioned earlier, Korea is an eclectic fusion of different cultures. Although Koreans would see themselves more as a member of an ethnic group living in a nation state that has been fighting for its independence from foreign domination. Their national identity has a solid thread of “self-reliance,” and mistrust in outside influences running through it. While things are evolving rapidly, it is still sufficiently normal for foreigners as a part of understanding Korean social norms to be at a loss to understand what Koreans are thinking in many situations. At the point when addressed around an especially odd or nonsensical appearing perspective for instance in everyday life, a typical answer is “Because I am Korean,” which says everything and nothing. Additionally, Koreans have a tendency to view society, nationality, dialect, and race as one-and-the-same and this may result in a genuine inability to grasp Western concepts of multi-cultural societies, where individuals are equal to each other. A Korean might, quite accurately, point out that indeed we are not equal and find it strange that we in the west ‘imagine’ being different.</p>

<h1><a  id="hoofdstuk">Beyond distributed and decentralized:<br> What is a federated network?</a></h1>
</div>

<article>
<div class="textwrapper">

<h3><a id="paulbaran">PAUL BARAN</a></h3>

<p>Paul Baran (1926-2011) was a Polish-American engineer who invented several technologies related to network architecture. His work on centralized vs decentralized architecture, during the cold war, was inspired by the need to design a network that could withstand a nuclear attack. <a id=link href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran" target="_blank">(More)</a></p>

<p>One of such labels is that of the federated network, a term often mentioned when talking about the architecture of (alternative) social networks such asDiaspora or Lorea. What is a federated network, though? The word itself hints at similarities with the political concept of a federation (see further on), but how such a state architecture would be applicable to networks is not immediately clear. In this essay, I will take a closer look at this term and how it fits in the network architecture discourse.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, Paul Baran in his classic 1964 text On distributed communication networks distinguishes three kinds of architectures that would be applicable to communication networks. As this text is often cited when discussing network architectures, it is a good place to start with an exploration of network architecture terminology. Baran envisions a network as an interconnected set of nodes, agents that can send and receive data. These nodes can then be organized in various ways, and this organization is what distinguishes the types of network architecture from each other.</p>


<h3><a id="terminology">TERMINOLOGY</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Network: A collection of interlinked nodes that exchange information.</li>
  <li>Node: The most basic part of the network; for example, a user or computer.</li>
  <li>Link: The connection between two nodes.</li>
  <li>Server: A node that has connections to a relatively large amount of other nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “traditional” network architecture is the centralized network, where all nodes send their data to one central node (a server), which then sends the data to the intended recipient. Then there’s the distributed network, where there’s no central server and each node is connected to various other nodes; data simply “hops” through whichever nodes allow for the shortest route to the recipient. Finally there’s the decentralized network, which could be characterized as a distributed network of centralized networks. When “zoomed out”, a decentralized network resembles a distributed network, but zooming in on the nodes of this distributed network reveals that the nodes in this network are in fact centralized networks, with the central node of each network connected to several other such central nodes. This way, the network does not rely on one single server, but splits the risk by having several such central nodes each manage a limited amount of “end point” nodes.</p>

<h3><a id="federation">FEDERATION</a></h3>
<p>In politics, a federation is a union of states (or other entities) that are partially self-governing and independent but have transferred a set of responsibilities and duties to a central government that unites them.
This is comprehensible enough, but what’s a federated network, then? Alternative social networks such as Diaspora and Lorea have been described as adopting a federated structure, but their server architecture is often strongly remeniscent of Baran’s description of a decentralized system. In Diaspora, for example, users become a member of a “pod”, and in principle only connect directly with their own pod; these pods in turn are connected to each other to allow users in different pods to interact with each other. This matches the “distributed network of centralized networks” description given above quite well.</p>

<p>Is federation just a synonym for decentralization, then? It depends on who you ask. For example, Arvind Narayanan et al., who wrote a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different network architectures inA Critical Look at Decentralized Personal Data Architectures, would disagree. They distinguish both federated and distributed networks – but mention that these are, in turn, two kinds of decentralized networks: here, “decentralized” is an umbrella term, unlike in Baran’s original text where decentralized networks were clearly distinct from distributed networks. It is clear from Narayanan et al.’s text, however, that their conception of a federated network matches Baran’s description of a decentralized network.</p>

<p>A completely different definition is used by Elijah Sparrow, involved with theCrabgrass alternative social network, in his response to Narayanan et al’s paper. Sparrow uses “decentralized” to refer to peer-to-peer networks, which is what both Narayanan et al and Baran would call “distributed”, meanwhile reserving the label “federated” for “client-to-server-to-server-to-client architectures”, which seems to be another way of describing Baran’s decentralized networks.</p>

<p>Lonneke van der Velden, in her 2013 text Meeting the Alternatives, offers yetanother conceptualization of the relation between decentralization and federation. Writing about the alternative social networks Diaspora and Lorea, she notes that “[decentralization] means that data is not stored on the servers owned by one central actor, but on federated servers”. In this instance, decentralization and federation do seem to be more or less two ways of saying the same thing, where “federation” is a mode of server organization that makes the network of these servers decentralized.</p>

<h3><a id="thesocialweb">THE SOCIAL WEB</a></h3>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Social Web Incubator Groupinvestigates how, through the use of web standards (such as HTML,OpenSocial or FOAF), an interoperable set of online social technologies can be developed and sustainably maintained.</p>

<p>Looking at another prominent adopter of “federated” terminology, theFederated Social Web W3C community group seems to have yet another conception of what it means for a network to be federated. According to the announcement of their Federated Social Web Summit in 2010, federation (in the context of social networks) is “letting people on different social networks follow each other”. The focus is in this case not so much on network architecture, but rather on data exchange: the FSW proposes that different networks adopt one unified data architecture so that a robust, heterogeneous network-of-networks can emerge. So for the FSW initiative, federation can be achieved through standardization of data formats: the precise connection between nodes and server is less relevant.</p>

<p>Having looked at several different ways of using these labels, where does this bring us? Apparently there’s no single agreed-upon definition of what a federated network is: there’s subtle differences between how the cited authors use this and other labels and sometimes the definitions that seem to be used even contradict each other. This is obviously a problem if one would want to discuss “federated networks” in a general sense.</p>

<p>The most sensible approach might be that of Narayanan et al, who use “decentralized” as an umbrella label that includes both federated and distributed networks. Semantically this is a solid categorization, as both types of network are indeed not centralized. As both federated and distributed networks have “not being centralized” as one of their main distinguishing features, it makes sense to include them in one category based on that characteristic.</p>

<p>Looking at just the “federated” label, what most authors seem to agree on is that a federated network is the same “distributed network of centralized networks” that Baran called decentralized. So in that sense, “federated” has replaced “decentralized” in its original meaning, while “decentralized” has been adopted in various different ways, mostly as an umbrella term. This is a reasonable redefinition, considering the fact that a distributed network could technically also be considered to be decentralized, and the close resemblance of the federated structure to the structure of a political federation, where autonomous sub-entities (such as American states) form one single larger entity (the United States).</p>

<p>The most workable middle ground, then, seems to be that a federated network is a distributed network with each node of this distributed network being a centralized network. Such a federated network is a type of decentralized network, with another type of such a network being the distributed network.</p>
