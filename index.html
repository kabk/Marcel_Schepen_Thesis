      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this thesis is to map out and assess the rise and changing path of (visual) South Korean [hereafter Korean] pop culture at a broad stroke. My intention is to provide useful signposts toward a more nuanced understanding of the politics of culture and the popular in its complex potential. Meanwhile, I try to make Korean culture understandable by drawing in examples of the history of Korea and Confucian sensibilities that still have a big prominence in the Korean (visual) cultural field. But also draw lines between Western and European to the Korean popular culture as an attempt to look for similarities. I do admit that my interpretation of the Korean culture is colored by a European perspective since I am born, raised and educated in Europe. But I will do my best to look at this case with a neutral mindset. In the rear of my trip to Seoul, at the end of October 2014, I had the opportunity to observe the Korean pop culture and a lot of perspectives are based on my observations and talks with the inhabitants of Seoul.</p> 

<p>One of the most special moments I had in Seoul was when I was in the metro, traveling through the city. In the metro there was an older man. He looked at me and I was a bit annoyed by his staring. Then he put up his hand as a friendly notion to say hello to me. I bowed and he started talking. He asked me where I came from. I told him that I was from Holland, visiting Korea to do research on Korean pop culture. He was very interested and was also telling me a bit about himself. He told me he was 76 six years old and still working. The man was very small; he only came up to my chest. He explained that Koreans stopped growing due to malnutrition. In the Korean War and right after, there was hardly any food available. He was very happy to see that more and more foreigners are visiting South Korea so he could still keep up with his English. And it pleased him that Korea gained so much in wealth. After this conversation I noticed what an impact this war was on the people. And how little I know about this war.</p>

<p>After the Korean War, which lasted for three years, Korea was a very poor nation with still a threat of a war. Yet things have changed almost irrevocably after this war. Firstly, American GI’s had a big influence on an early attempt of a popular culture in Korea that could be seen as cultural colonization from the west. In addition, since the early 1970s, modernization under successive developmental regimes has been intensified. Which had drastic consequences to this early attempt of a popular culture. Secondly, the breakdown in the hegemony of the once dominant traditional discourse and counter-hegemonic movements.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER 1: VISUAL CULTURE</h1>
<p>1.1	What is a pop culture?</p>
<p>To understand a pop culture it is recommended to have a better understanding about visual culture. This raises the question, What is visual culture? A visual culture means the predominance of visual forms of media, communication, and information in the postmodern world . This term is still a bit vague; it implies that there could have been a cultural shift to the visual over against the verbal and textual. But the ‘visual culture’ supports the reality of living in a world of interventions on different levels where in history these expressions were less visible. Our experience of culturally meaningful visual content appears in multiple forms that could be “high” and “low” cultural forms such as print images and graphic design, Television and broadcasting networks, film and video, computer interfaces and software design, digital multimedia, fine art and photography, fashion but also architecture, design, and urban design.</p> 

<p>This growth of visual culture has a lot to do with technical development but also with the upcoming of postmodernism, a movement that started after/ around the two world wars. This movement assumes the idea that we cannot speak of any universal truth, reason or morality. We just have fragmented perspectives. 
But what then is a pop culture? Pop culture is the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes images and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture, which is different than folk culture. Folk culture is a culture that is homogenous in ethnicity, rural and consists of a smaller population. Where folk culture is only linked to ethnicity, pop culture exists out of many ethnic groups and develops itself slower than pop culture. Folk culture is what we could see as more traditional.</p> 

<p>Norman Mailer suggests that a pop culture started when there was an upcoming of a counterculture, a youth culture. Norman Mailer first noted an upcoming movement of a pop culture in the west in his essay “The White Negro: superficial reflections on the hipster” . In this essay he described American Existentialists what he calls “Hipsters”. He describes these young white people around 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The described hipster refuses submission to the anxieties that are the result of various wars. In fact, the hipster can only function on the outskirts of society, for he defines himself in opposition to any notion of collective responsibility. He is “rarely an artist,” and “never a writer”, but more likely “a minor criminal, a hobo, a carnival worker or a free-lance moving man in Greenwich Village”. He is his only engagement. The hipster wanted to make his own decisions and started to listen to typical “black” music like jazz and swing music and dressed himself in a different fashion so much that he adopted the “black” culture as it’s own to break free from the paths of society and previous generations. Living a life surrounded by death as a result of various alarming wars and being constrained by social conformity this movement eventually resulted in a youth culture that around the 1960s that was seen as popular culture.</p>

<p>1.2 What is interesting about Korean pop culture?</p>

<p>South-Korea was once one of the poorest and least fashionable countries in the world. But over the last couple of decades it changed itself into a High-tech nation and cultural superpower. Popular Korean culture is mentioned as one of the quickest flourishing pop cultures in the world. The song Gangnam Style from Korean rapper PSY has over 21 billion views on youtube. Fillipinos are hooked on Korean drama’s, the French love it’s pop music and their movies. In 2013 Korea made $5 billion from its pop-culture exports and the country has set its sights on doubling that by 2017 . This describes more the attitude of the country, there are also visual differences in the korean pop culture.</p> 

<p>In writing you can see that Korean writing is different from other asian writings. The text is set in Hangul, the native alphabet of Korea. This script was created during the Joseon dynasty in 1443  and is based on phonetics. The script exists out of 24 letters but are grouped in blocks instead of in a row what is done in Latin alphabet. K-Pop is another example. K-Pop is a musical genre originating from South Korea and stands for Korean Pop music. The music is a mix of different genres like pop, rock, hiphop, RnB and electronic music. K-Pop can be described as globalized music; it is a mixture of Western and European sounds with an Asian flavor of performance.  Contemporary Korean art could also be suggested as globalized art and gains rapidly ground in the international art scene. With their artists often educated in London or New York.</p> 

<p>Based on these statements I assume that most of it’s pop culture is a fusion between Western, European and other cultures which could be because of the fact that their students study abroad at Western and European universities and after their studies will move back to Korea to start with their career.</p>
<br>
<p>1.3 This could be interesting because…</p>
 
<p>There are two ways to look at this question. When I was talking with Koreans in Seoul about the Hallyu , the flow and spread of Korea, they mentioned me that people say that the three economic powers in eastern asia follow eachother up. First you have Japan, ten years later Korea follows and ten years after that China will follow with a quick economic growth. Stating this, it could be interesting to see how the chinese growth will develop and using these growths of Japan and Korea as a theory you could predict the growth of China.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that as mentioned earlier Korea is a fusion of different cultures. While things are evolving rapidly, it is still sufficiently normal, for foreigners, to be at a loss to understand what Koreans are thinking in many situations. At the point when addressed around an especially odd or nonsensical appearing perspective, a typical answer is “Because I am Korean," which says everything and nothing. Additionally, Koreans have a tendency to view society, nationality, dialect, and race as one-and-the-same and this may result in a genuine inability to grasp Western concepts of multi-cultural societies, where individuals are equal to each other. A Korean might, quite accurately, point out that indeed we are not equal and find it strange that we ‘imagine’ being different.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER 2: HISTORY</h1>
<p>2.1 History in Korean culture</p>

<p>To get a better understanding about the culture and about the drive to become a cultural superpower it’s essential to have an idea about the history of Korea. After several conversations with Koreans I noticed what an impact the Korean War had on the people, how it changed their ideas and how little I know about this war. <i>(Take this part out?)</i></p>

<p>Before the Korean War, which caused the split of North and South Korea, Korea was part of the Japanese empire . In 1592 Japan invaded the peninsula to pave its way for its incursion into China. However this failed, Korea remained to be a “Hermit Kingdom”. Over time, a few Asian and European countries with imperialistic ambitions competed with each other for influence over the Korean Peninsula. But Japan, after winning wars against China and Russia, forcibly annexed Korea and instituted the colonial rule in 1910. The colonization process stimulated the patriotism of Koreans. Korean intellectuals were angered by Japan's cultural assimilation policy, that even banned Korean-language education in schools. The colonial rule ended by the end of the Second World War in 1945.<p>

<p>Even before South Korea could enjoy the fruits of their freedom due to the surrender of Japan after WWII. The liberation didn’t bring the independence the Koreans have fought so hard for. Instead it resulted in a country divided by ideological differences. Korean efforts to gain an independent government were frustrated as Soviet troops took control over the northern and U.S. forces occupied the southern half of the peninsula and with the emergence of the Cold War this was not going to end soon.</p>

<p>On June the 25, 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea poured 75,000 soldiers across the 38th parallel.  A division between the Soviet-backed (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) North Korea and the pro-Western (Republic of Korea) South Korea was based on the circle latitude that is 38 degrees north of the Earth’s equatorial plane. This invasion was the first military action of the Cold War. And as far as American officials were concerned, it was a war against the forces of international communism itself. At the same time, American officials worked fearful to construct a peace between the two Korea’s. The alternate, they feared, would be a wider war with Russia and China. Or even, as some people warned, World War III. The U.S. “police action” was run by a UN (United Nations) international peace- keeping force but actually U.S. and NATO anti-communist interests were manipulating the UN.</p>

<p>When after more than two years of negotiations the adversaries signed a treaty that was signed on July 27, 1953. The agreement allowed the prisoners of war to stay where they liked, drew a new boundary near the 38th parallel that gave South-Korea an extra 3500 square kilometers of territory and created a 3-kilometer-wide ‘demilitarized zone’ that still exists today. Although the Korean War was approximately short, it was extremely bloody. Nearly 5 million people died. More than half of these people were civilians, and was about 10 percent of Korea's prewar population. Almost 40,000 American soldiers died in action in Korea, and more than 100,000 were wounded. North Korea was left under communist rule after the treaty of 1953, and to this day it remains a poor and troubled nation.</p>

<p>South Korea's growth and national culture oriented development was led under the leadership of Park Chung-Hee , the general-turned-president, from 1960 following 18 years of authoritarian rule. His effect on Korea's development was so remarkable that it earned the name “the Miracle on the Hangang River”. During the busy efforts of restoration after the war, education became South Korea's highest priority. With a struggle from day to day and children traveling over long distances to go to school, the Korean parents did not ignore the importance of education. This dedication to, and investment in, education produced a highly trained workforce that would become later on one of the forces behind Korea's economic turn-around. These days education is still one of the highest priorities. And putting your kids on private schools and get extra classes to prepare them for the best universities in the world is seen as prestige.</p>

<p>2.2 First notions of a popular culture</p>

<p>In Korea the formation of a pop culture happened differently than in the west and was heavily forced by American GI's. When after the Korean treaty was signed, American GI's stayed in South Korea for the protection of a second threat of North Korea. For the entertainment of these troops the AFKN (American Forces Korean Network) was broadcast in this area. The AFKN is a radio and television service for the entertainment of U.S. Troops. Korean teenagers would gather around small transistor radios to listen to the music from this broadcast station.  Without a doubt this was influencing the music culture in Korea and one of the first notions of Cultural Imperialism. The Cultural Imperialism refers to the creation of a clear line between the political and economic domination of a more powerful civilization over its colonies. In this case the U.S. over Korea. The U.S. Military base was an improbable incubator of a fledgling Korean counterculture movement.</p>

<p>These influences started when there was a growing need of entertainment at American military bases. Usually these entertainments came from American artists, like Elvis Presley, Nat King Cole or Marilyn Monroe, and were flown in to Korea but they could not satisfy the huge demand coming over more than 150 camps around the country. Therefore U.S. Army hired Korean musicians to fill the void, and amid the destitution of postwar Korea. Many hungry musicians flocked to bases for the precious jobs. These musicians already had been exposed to American artists and this imitation of imported styles became a stimulus to the creation of hybrid styles, in which musicians blend elements from local musical traditions and add native language lyrics. Usually it started of with a pre audition at an agency and when musicians or bands wore considered worthy they were allowed to join the show ensemble to then audition in front of the U.S. Military authorities, which would make the final decision if the ensemble were qualified. These ssoydan (Korean for ensembles) would not just be a simple music concert but was an entertainment variety show consisting of a big band, singers, comedians, dancers and other performers with a band as a center point. These bands usually did not play one style or genre. Versatility was crucial to the survival of a band and therefore tried to master as many as they could with an enormous pressure to learn the latest hits on the U.S. Pop chart in particular. Without any sheet music available the only way to learn these songs were to record the AFKN broadcast and then practice day and night.</p>

<p>However these bands were popular among American troops, only a small Korean public was receptive to their music. The bands had the time on their side but when the big public was opening up to them the state-led “ Fatherland Modernization” (choguk kŭndaehwa) period of the 1960s and 1970s started. This high-speed industrialization and grow of nationalism was the states policy under the leadership of General Park Chung-Hee that was started by a military coup in 1961 . This led into a rapid urbanization and harsh oppression of dissenting voices.</p> 

<p>2.3 Oppression by Park Chung Hee</p>

<p>In 1971 the three-day Cheongpyeong Festival drew a crowd of thousands of people. This festival, whose communal experiences were similar to Woodstock and the ‘Summer of Love’, this was the arrival of the global youth counterculture in Korea. People had long hair, flared jeans, used recreational drugs and had an antiauthority attitude . Korean rock music along with fledgling modern folk movement provided a soundtrack for this new cultural drama. But the authoritarian Park regime decided to take action against this new culture as it was deemed “vulgar” and “decadent”. The police began stopping young people for a snap inspection. Men got a free haircut on the spot if their hair was considered too long and women's skirts had to be long enough to cover their knee. The streets of Seoul changed into a theater of the absurd where police officers were armed with measuring sticks and imposed the “discipline of the body” on the unlucky spectators. Between 1965 and 1975 this oppression eventually led to a total of 223 Korean songs and 261 Western pop songs that were blacklisted.</p> 

<p>The goal of all of this national culture revival was ultimately political and is an opportunistic move to recover from the Korea-Japan normalization treaty that had put constraints on the national culture by its former colonial master. Although the Rock movement in Korea neither offered social nor political critique. Basically this was an American cultural import that was spontaneously accepted and glocalized by the Koreans themselves. And it was seen as a political threat by the regime because it had something was so unsettling about it.

<h1>CHAPTER 3: CULTURE IS AN ECLECTIC PROCESS</h1>
<p>3.1 The detraditionilazation of society</p>

<p>Korean culture has been and still is conceived and rearticulated along the lines of Confucian legacies and ideals and an official homogenizing and highly collectivistic ethnic- and patriotic nationalism. Later on I will come back to this Confucian legacy. This collective ethnic- and patriotic nationalism have created an unified ‘us’ versus ‘them’ mindset against invading foreign powers. However in the 1980’s and 1990’s the mainstream became a fertile field of difference where a multiplicity of social forces struggle to secure their cultural hegemony and dominance . In the late 1980s, at the socio-economic level, Korea had achieved a high performing economy. This all was thanks to the mass-production electronic industries where Koreans copied western products to sell for a cheaper price on the market. The Hyundai Pony, a car designed by Europeans but produced in Korea, is an example of these growing industries . As a result of this economic welfare the standard of living has been drastically improved. Quick and profound cultural, spatial and technological changes and mutations appeared in the South Korean daily life. Maybe there is no clearer example than the spatial landscape of the capital city of Seoul. Where in the glitzy and active urban scenes, in particular the pleasure-sites and cultural areas in Seoul, Euro-American cultural products and styles popped up among the youth and urban professionals. It is generally accepted that, in the late 1990s, Korean society had grown so much that it entered a highly consumption-oriented phase where people gained a passion for foreign travel and a better quality of life . So it is no wonder that there are rising concerns on practices of consumption, life styles and identities.</p>

<p>As mentioned, in the past and until recently, culture in Korea was largely treated as almost homogeneous. A country bound by an ethnic belief and territorial logic centered on the ‘imaginary Korean nation’. Historically in Korea there was an assumed comparison or strong organic ties between culture, people, territory and language where the relative homogeneity of linguistic, ethnic and cultural characteristics were set up as an justification for the being and masculinized Korean cultural nation . Although the nation lost considerable hailing power during the 1990s, stereotyped nationalism and other authoritarian ideas and Confucian discourses are still potentially powerful forces to look upon with in the local setting.</p> 

<p>The first changes in the ‘us’ versus ‘them’ perception appeared around the 1980s where the organic and essentializing nature of oppositional culture, which was based on exclusionary binarisms, were questioned. For the Korean bourgeois culture is like a strong organic glue that binds Koreans within the national space where any potentially violation against moral or social boundaries should be kept out. For the previous government, culture of the people has been applied to a valuable resource and powerful history. This is one of the reasons why they expanded traditional folk and the minjung (a Korean word which is hard to describe but literally means ‘mass of the people’) cultural forms like, folk music, dance, songs and drama against the official (sanitizing) discourses of accepted nationalism and the alienating consumerist culture. The previous government had the idea that the culture of the working class and farmers should have an authentic, healthy, and less perverted way of life and everyday struggles . However in the 1990s, with the rise of popular youth culture and new generations of ‘cultural tribes’, consumers and manufacturers ¬were stimulated and the once secured image of an hegemonic national culture and collective construction of Koreanness seem to be turned upside down. Heterogeneous sets of ideas, passions, aspirations, life styles and the ‘toolkits’ for an counter-identity formation in every day life became the new ethos. This was especially because of the flickering images of daily doses of global popular culture on the streets. And in the current Korea the presence of diverse, and clashing cultures of different generations of people and their structures of feeling, the ritual mystique, organic, united and homogeneous model of national culture is definitely under pressure and losing ground.</p>


<p>3.2 Confucianism/ Social order</p>

<p>Admitting Korean culture has undergone a rapid change still the values of Confucian ideals are in the base of their society. But what is actually Confucianism? Confucianism is to some extent Humanism, a philosophy or attitude that is concerned with human beings, but in Korea conceived as a religion with its own rituals. And is developed from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE) . Some people say Confucianism is not a religion because there are no Confucian supreme beings and no teachings about the afterlife. Confucius himself was a strong supporter of the ritual, however, and for many centuries there were state rituals associated with Confucianism. The most important tradition of Confucianism is about the shaping of social relationships and moral thoughts . The founder of Confucianism was Kong Qui, a Chinese intellectual that was born around 551 and died in 479 BCE. The Latinized name Confucius was created by 16th-century missionaries in China. Confucius was a teacher to the sons of the upper class when formal education was just beginning in China. He traveled from region to region with a small group of disciples, which later would become important government officials. Confucius was not particularly famous during his lifetime and even considered himself to be a failure. He became an advisor to a powerful ruler and believed that such a ruler, with the right advice, could bring an ideal world. Confucius said heaven and the afterlife were beyond human capacity to understand, and therefore one should concentrate on doing the right thing in his life instead. Early records from one of his students indicate that he did not provide many moral commandments. He would rather thought an attitude toward one’s other fellow humans of respect, particularly respect to one’s parents, teachers, and elders. He also encouraged his students to learn from everyone they would meet and honor to others’ cultural norms. Later on his teachings would be translated by authoritarian political thinkers into strict guidelines and would be associated with an permanent hierarchy of authority and unquestioning obedience.</p>

<p>Talking with Koreans in Seoul explained me a lot about how this idea of Confucianism would apply itself in everyday life as social norms. In every day life Korean make Confucian-style thoughts, but this does not mean Korean people consciously try to follow Confucian laws. It is very rare to find a Korean person who explicitly connects her code of conduct to Confucianism. Relational understanding of humans is absolutely the most important aspect of Confucianism that operates in Korea today. A Korean considers this aspect to be the most significant, not only because it is the strongest influence of Confucianism that can be observed in modern Korean society, but also because it is the most different from the Western mode of thought. With a greater emphasis on relationships, individuals are on a second place. In Confucianism, a person does not exist autonomously. To exist alone is not enough. It is the link to another person that makes that person a human. This relational understanding of humans thoroughly pervades Korean society, affecting behaviors as well as their thought process. When two Koreans meet for the first time, they spent the first few minutes asking each other how old they are, what they do, where they are from, etc.</p>

<p>That last point about classification is also pervasive in Korean culture. Except for close friends it is rare for Korean adults to call each other by name only. In fact, even the word "you" is rarely used. Various "relationship words" are used instead.  If there is no direct relationship to be found, then one's social position is a decent substitute. In addition to this classification, social interactions of Koreans also tend to be a constant recognition and reaffirmation of relationships. Koreans bow to elders and seniors. Polite Koreans give things with two hands as a signal to show respect. Korean manners require that you never show up empty-handed to visit another person's house. And maintaining a relational understanding of humans leads to a constant assessment of everyone's "place." If you want to know your relationship to another, you need to understand your position relative to another. And your position always comes with a certain set of "what you are supposed to do." The natural outgrowth is that Koreans end up caring a great deal about social status. And as specified before it is not just the individual that makes a person; it is also the type of social links that the individual creates with other individuals and the larger society. This necessarily involves a constant survey of one's place in relation to the world, which in turn fuels one's desire to have a higher social status whenever possible.

<h1>CHAPTER 4: KOREAN CULTURE AS AN EXPORT PRODUCT</h1>
<p>4.1 The Korean Dream</p>
<p>In the 1980s Korea was as mentioned before mainly a manufacture country and was known because of its copies of Western products. When the country changed its ideas on copying goods in the 1990s they were determined to become more influential. It already learned a lot about modern techniques and now started to make their own products that became the front-runner of technology and slowly became a High-Tech nation. Look at brands like Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kia. But also in Fashion they became bigger with designers like, Juun J. and Wooyungmi.</p>

<p>But how did they start to export their own culture? When in 2001 by “accident” the song ‘Honey’ by musician Park Jin-Yeong and several other Korean pop artists became a hit in China Korean newspapers started to write about this new phenomenon, which is they called ‘The Korean Wave’ or Hallyu . The Korean Wave is additionally seen as a manifestation of 5,000 years of pent up energy as a result of oppression. This Korean boom was further boosted by the advance of Korean movies but more than anything else Korean pop music, which often incorporates dynamic rhythms, powerful dances and lyrics that felt progressive of rebellious enough to attract the youth. These new adapters are classified as the “Korean Tribes” and are aggressively adopting and mimicking Korean lifestyles ranging from fashion, food and consumption patterns, to even plastic surgery. This last one got so much out of hand that the city of Seoul is now restricting advertisements on plastic surgery in the city because they were fueling an unhealthy obsession with the body image. Under the new regulations metro stations can only 20% of the advertisements are allowed to be connected to plastic surgery and overly sensational before and after pictures and slogans are going to be banned . The Hallyu was first praised as a pride of “Korean Culture” most likely because nationalistic people felt that Korea finally joined the ranks of advanced nations. This pride is linked to the notions of cultural essentialism and the prevalent of this popularity in other Asian countries stems from family values and Confucian sensibility.</p>

<p>But is the Korean Pop Culture essentially different from other pop cultures? In cultural and nationalistic discourse it’s voiced that Korean culture compared to American and Japanese culture is less violent. Another argument that it is popular in Asia is because of anti-Japanese and anti-American sentiments. China is ideologically opposed to America and this is the same with Japan. For Korea this is entirely different, they see no sense of competitiveness with Korea, which does not say that they look down on Korean; they view Korea as a country to learn from . And over discourse it’s being mentioned that when China emerges as a new cultural furnace, it will most likely mean East Asia’s emergence from cultural colonialism . But to counter this cultural colonization Korea should search for something “authentically Korean” instead of copying the homogenous pop culture. One of these options was coined by the television documentary producer Seo Hyeon-cheol, he was convinced that Korean dance music could be a world competitive export item and said that even though Korean dance music was derived from Japan or America, it is inevitably colored by Korean sensibilities during the process of copying. The people who created the so-called Hallyu are not people who create the so-called “high” or traditional “Korean culture”. But mainly it comes from Korean dance music. Seo calls this love of music and dance a “Korean sensibility”.</p> 

<p>In 2005 the Samsung Economic Research Institute published a special report on the economic effects of the Hallyu. Entitled “The Korean Wave Sweeps the Globe” the report classifies countries that import Korean pop culture into four stages. The first stage is that of simply enjoying Korean pop culture, this is applied to countries as Egypt, Mexico and Russia. The second stage involves buying related products such as posters, character items, and tours, the countries classified for this stage are Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The third stage is buying “Made in Korea” products and China and Vietnam are qualified for this stage. The fourth and final stage reflects the development of a general preference for Korean culture itself. According to the report, there are no countries that could be applied for this stage. To accomplish this fourth stage it is suggested by the report that people need to be made interested in Korean culture through “feeling Korean” by increasing the export of Korean food, drinks and lifestyles which contain the essence of Korean aesthetics, emotions, traditions and culture by modeling itself in the rear of “Japonism”. The style that made Japan its existence known to European culture at the end of the nineteenth century. The report added that when the sensibility contained in these contents go beyond “Korean sensibility” to include Asian values such as Neo-Confucian and family values, then it would be more appealing to non-Koreans and in that way South-Korea could build a cultural Silk Road.</p>


<p>4.2 K-Pop</p>

<p>As specified before, K-Pop or Korean Pop Music is one of the biggest (pop) cultural export products of Korea. Since the late 1990s, K-pop has been regarded as one of the most successful cases among Asian pop music. The danceable rhythms and catchy melody performed by good-looking singers and groups were first swept across East and South-East Asia but later on to other parts of the world as well. These singers and groups are no amateurs but actually have a big organization behind them, a kind of education system. This ‘star manufacturing system’ was born in the early 1990s  and eventually expended itself into a specific training and education system. Star aspirants register at an academy as trainees and take the lessons necessary to be a star. After learning applicable skills, the chosen few are entitled to become members of idol groups, usually this would be boy-groups or girl-groups. Later these idol groups would go to the next stage of hard training that mostly begins with living together in a house provided by the company. By this, stars are discovered, educated and exploited through seamless control by the entertainment companies, which on itself is a hard working industry . Where before the Korean pop stars were a stereotype of pretty boys and girls lip-syncing and dancing on music, by the early 2000s the new type of star had to look more ‘real’ or ‘less artificial’. This was a result of the target audience that moved from teenage girls to women who were in their mid-20s to 30s. This was mainly because these women had a larger buying power. After the Hallyu, K-pop became more popular and these academies focused itself on the global market as well. An explanation to this global approach of the music industries could be that they found that ‘Asians’ are everywhere on the globe. Beyond Asia, this music existed as a form of Asian migrants culture in America and elsewhere in the West.</p>

<p>The biggest break through of K-pop happened in 2012 and was a result of the popularity of the song ‘Gangnam style’ by the Korean rapper PSY. The song is referencing a sort of elite, “Nouveau Riche”, wealthy culture and lifestyle that has sprung up around Gangnam, a small area in Seoul. PSY explained: “Gangnam residents are seen as “good-looking because of plastic surgery, stylish because they can splurge on luxury goods, and slim thanks to yoga and personal trainers. But People who are actually from Gangnam never proclaim that they are ¬– it’s only the posers and wannabes that put on these airs and say that they are “Gangnam Style” – the song is actually poking fun at those kinds of people who are trying so hard to be something that they’re not. ” ‘Gangnam Style’ might look like it went spontaneously viral on the Internet. Actually it was a precisely executed campaign by the Korean label company behind the song to make a definite break through of K-pop music in the Western and European market.</p>


<p>4.3 Korean art</p>

<p>An option to grow this “Korean Sensibility” could be through the arts. Arts are a good cultural export product and are completely different from the pop culture. Korean art could create a modern view on traditional “Korean Culture”. Recently Korean artists are mentioned as one of the new tastemakers and history-making headliners in the global art scene . Often these artists are educated in London or New York at the most renowned schools. By fusing cutting-edge technology and popular trends these artists reflect the disturbing yet celebratory, self-contradictory clashes and divided psyche. They do this by reflecting on topics like K-pop, ancient Confucian values, the latest cosmetic surgery as a possible subject and historical events.</p>

<p>One of the more known Korean artists is Nam June Paik. Born in 1932 he is an artist that experienced this whole change in Korea. In the 1950s, during the Korean war, he and his family left their home and fled to Japan. His art works are mentioned as futurist and he was part of the Fluxus movement that was highly inspired by the composer John Cage. As one of the first artists to work with television and video, transforming both forms of popular media into art. He stressed that electronic media is not sculpture or painting, but a ‘time art’. A prescient theorist whose writings were as visionary as his art, he’s credited with inventing the term ‘electronic superhighway’ and stating that ‘the future is now’. His most famous work is TV Buddha, here Paik brings together the past and present, the old and new, the real and illusory. The Buddha perpetually gazes at the TV screen, on which he sees an image of himself recorded by the closed-circuit camera.</p>

<p>Another artist is photographer Park Sung Jun, born in Seoul but studied painting and photography in New York. Since 2001 he has worked on a series of portraits called ‘Kid Nostalgia’ which is a portrait of teenagers in Seoul. After spending his 20s in New York he decided to go back to Seoul and was 'shocked' by the existing youth culture how everyone looked alike. But also saw the little gemstones that as little rebels don't fit in with their clothing and looks. These youngsters have different haircuts or dress themselves differently and therefore they are not accepted by society . The way they reveal themselves as they roam around the periphery of the school system is so raw that there’s an ironic beauty to it. There’s a sort of imperfect freedom and recklessness to their rebellion and sadness, to their style that the older generation refuses to tolerate. While Park was doing this project, he often thought that he was, in a sense, trying to find his own forgotten roots. Although he found out that it wasn’t so much about finding an “answer”. <i>The chapter should get a different ending?</i>

<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>“What is an authentic national culture when some alien
cultural practices are so quickly assimilated that after a short while they are no longer remembered as alien”
- John Tomlinson<br></br>
South-Korea was once one of the poorest and least fashionable countries in the world. But over the last couple of decades it changed itself into a High-tech nation and cultural superpower. Undergoing colonial domination, war, rapid economic growth and a financial crisis all within the same century. Popular Korean youth culture is mentioned as one of the quickest flourishing youth cultures in the world. This all started when Hallyu also called the Korean Wave was born and was first mentioned by media in 2001.
The first notions of a youth culture came when western pop culture was introduced in South-Korea by U.S. Armed Forces, a powerful symbol of postwar American hegemony. Here was the start of “Rok” the Korean appropriation of Rock music. But was later banned by the militaristic regime of Park Chung Hee.
In my thesis I will answer my question “What effected popular youth culture in South-Korea from the 1960’s onward?” I am going to look into the history of South-Korea and how it became this High-Tech nation and cultural superpower. I will write about the first attempts of creating a youth culture and later draw in examples about cultural imperialism and Confucianism. Also I will interview Koreans who have been part of this change and interview Koreans who moved abroad and came back to a country which evolved into an alienated country to them. Finally I will write about the Hallyu that eventually became the “Korean Dream”.<br></br>
